                Hi there
            </h2>
            <p>
            This is my personal page where I'll put my stuff and my javascript pet projecs.<br/>
            It's not meant to be a clean portfolio rather than some form of playground for me, as I'm getting
            familiar with React and TypeScript.<br/>
            I work as a Senior Software Engineer in Microsoft Dublin, in the Havok office.<br/>
            I started programming when I was a tiny 9 year old, in GWBasic on
            an 8086 and the fascination of writing and running a piece of code stuck with me for many years, eventually
            turning into a profession.<br/>
            Parallely to my love for coding, I have a long term relationship with music (also started when I was around the same age),
            and pursued some sort of semi-professional career as a sax player. After moving to Ireland my programming side became
            prevalent, but I'm trying to rekindle my musical side by playing in my spare time as much as possible. <br/>
            <br/>
            You'll find here a few projects I'm working on in bits and pieces. As you can see they are all music related.<br/>
            <br/>
            Normally I'm more funny than this, but this is just a template... I'll update it later on!<br/>
            <br/>
            Cheers,<br/>
